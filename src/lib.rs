//! An opinionated color management library built on top of [`kolor`](https://docs.rs/kolor).
//!
//! # Introduction
//!
//! `colstodian` is a practical color management library for games and graphics.
//! It encodes various information about a color either statically
//! in the Rust type system (as with the strongly-typed [`Color`]),
//! or as data contained in the type (as with the dynamically-typed [`DynamicColor`]).
//!
//! Although it is designed to prevent footguns wherever possible, in order to make use of this library,
//! you should have a well-working understanding of basic color science and encoding principles.
//! As such, I highly recommend you give sections 2.0 and 2.1 of this document a read, as it is one
//! of the main inspirations for how this library is structured:
//!
//! All colors in Ark will now be accompanied either statically or dynamically with two important pieces
//! of metadata, a **color space** and a **state**. A basic background on color encoding is necessary to
//! understand what these pieces of metadata are and why they are important.
//!
//! ## Color Encoding Basics
//!
//! Much like how a 3d vector like a `glam::Vec3` could be used to describe any of:
//!
//! * The motion vector of an object in meters per second
//! * The position of an object relative to a reference point in kilometers
//! * Three "wellness scores" for a character, which each axis representing how happy the charcter is about some aspect of their life
//!
//! A bag of components that describes "a color" could actually be interpreted in many different ways, and the end result of what
//! those components mean is very different. There are two important pieces of metadata about a color which inform how we are meant
//! to interpret its component values: the color's **Color Space** and its **State**.
//!
//! ### Color Spaces
//!
//! A "color space" is a fairly nebulous term which has different definitions depending on who you talk to, but the basic idea is that
//! it provides a specific organization of color data in an agreed-upon format. The color space provides almost all the information needed
//! to fully interpret the component data. However, it is missing one important piece of metadata which is relevant when working with rendered
//! scenes that may have higher dynamic range within the scene than an actual display is capable of displaying (a computer monitor cannot replicate
//! the brightness of the sun, but within the renderer, we want to actually simulate those high brightnesses). That is where the color state comes in.
//!
//! ### Color State
//!
//! As we have discussed, all colors have units. Sometimes a colorâ€™s units are explicit, such as measuring the emitted light from a display using a
//! radiometric measurement tool and being able to reference pixel values in a color space built for that. Other times, the units are only indirectly
//! related to the real world, but come with a mathematical conversion to measurable quantities. For example, in the case of display technology, common
//! color encodings include sRGB, DCI-P3, and BT.2020, which are all standards which actual monitors attempt to replicate.
//!
//! However, considering color as a displayed quantity only provides part of the color encoding story. In addition to relating color values to
//! **display measurements**, as we did above, one can also relate color values to the performance characteristics of an **input device** (i.e., a
//! camera, or in our case, a virtual camera in a 3d renderer). In this case, we are quantifying color values which originated in the (virtual) **scene**,
//! rather than ones being displayed on a display. This kind of color can be measured in real world units as well. In the case of a 3d renderer, these units
//! are often defined in the renderer as a photometric quantity like luminance, with the relation to reference color values dictated by a defined transformation.
//!
//! It is a meaningful abstraction to categorize colors based on this distinction of *input* versus *output* reference. We refer to this
//! difference as a color's **State**. Colors which are defined in relation to *display characteristic* are called **Display-referred**, while
//! color spaces which are defined in relation to *input devices* (scenes) are **Scene-referred**.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! `colstodian` is broken up into two 'halves', a statically-typed half which is meant to be
//! used as much as possible to help you prevent errors at compile time through leveraging the
//! Rust type system, and a dynamically-typed half which is meant to be used when serializing
//! and deserializing colors and otherwise interacting with colors from dynamic sources not
//! known at compile time.
//!
//! The core of the statically-typed half is the [`Color`] type, which encodes
//! two important pieces of metadata about the color in its type signature (`Color<Space, State>`): the
//! color's **color space** and **state**. If you read the color encoding basics above (you did, didn't you? ;) )
//! then you should have a decent idea of what both of these things mean. To be clear, the **color space**
//! encodes the **primaries**, **white point**, and **transfer functions** upon which the color values are
//! based. The **state** encodes in which "direction" we relate the color values to real-world quantities:
//! either **scene-referred** or **display-referred**. Types which implement the [`ColorSpace`] and
//! [`State`] traits encode this information statically. Color spaces can be found in the `spaces` module
//! and states can be found in the `states` module.
//!
//! The core of the dynamically-typed half is the [`DynamicColor`] type, which encodes the color space
//! and state as data stored in the type at runtime. It stores these as [`DynamicColorSpace`]s and [`DynamicState`]s.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Let's say we have a color that we got from an asset loaded from a color image or a color picker,
//! which are often in the encoded sRGB color space.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! let loaded_asset_color = color::srgb_u8(128, 128, 128);
//! ```
//!
//! But wait, we can't do much with this color yet...
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let loaded_asset_color = color::linear_srgb::<Display>(0.5, 0.5, 0.5); // fake it so that doc tests pass
//! let my_other_color = loaded_asset_color * 5.0; // oops, compile error!
//! ```
//!
//! This color is encoded in a non-linear format. You can think of this much like
//! as if a file was compressed as a ZIP. Doing operations directly on the zipped
//! bytes is nonsensical. First we need to decode it to work on the raw data.
//! In the same way, before we can do math on this color, we need to convert it to a working color space.
//!
//! Encoded color spaces all have a working color space that they can decode to directly. This will be the
//! least expensive and most natural conversion if you want to work with them directly. For example,
//! an [EncodedSrgb] color will decode to a [LinearSrgb] color:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let loaded_asset_color = color::srgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
//! // Note the type annotation here is unnecessary, but is useful for illustrative purposes.
//! let decoded: Color<LinearSrgb, Display> = loaded_asset_color.decode();
//!
//! let my_other_color = decoded * 0.5; // yay, it works!
//! ```
//!
//! You can also convert an encoded color fully to a specific working space if you have one
//! in mind. For example, if you want to blend between two colors, you might convert them to
//! the [Oklab] color space:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! let oklab1 = color::srgb_u8(128, 12, 57).convert::<Oklab>();
//! let oklab2 = color::srgb_u8(25, 35, 68).convert::<Oklab>();
//!
//! let blended = lerp(oklab1..=oklab2, 0.5); // Blend half way between the two colors
//! ```
//!
//! This is also the first time we see the [`convert`][Color::convert] method, which we'll be using
//! to do most of our conversions. You can use this to do pretty much any conversion you like, so long
//! as you stay within the same [State]. See the docs of that method for more information. Generally, you'll
//! want to convert the color to some output color space before actually using it. It's quite common to use
//! [EncodedSrgb] for this purpose. This is also quite simple with `convert`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let blended: Color<Oklab, Display> = Color::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
//! // Note the slightly different style. Here we annotate the type of `output`
//! // rather than using the turbofish operator to specify the destination color
//! // space, and Rust infers the type on the `convert` method for us.
//! let output: Color<EncodedSrgb, Display> = blended.convert();
//!
//! // Some applications will want a color in the form of an array of `u8`s.
//! // Certain encoded color spaces will allow you to convert a color in that
//! // space to/from an array of `u8`s. EncodedSrgb is one of those:
//! let output_u8: [u8; 3] = output.to_u8();
//! ```
//!
//! Also note that you can break out of the restrictions imposed by the type system
//! or otherwise get the raw color by accessing `color.raw`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! let mut encoded_color = color::srgb_u8(127, 127, 127);
//! encoded_color.raw *= 0.5; // This works!
//! ```
//!
//! You can also access the components of a color by that component's name. For example,
//! a [Linear sRGB][LinearSrgb] color has components `r`, `g`, and `b`, so you can do:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let linear_srgb_color = color::linear_srgb::<Display>(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
//! let red_component = linear_srgb_color.r;
//! ```
//!
//! However, if a color is in a different color space, for example [`ICtCpPQ`], which has different
//! component names, then you would access those components accordingly:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! let col: Color<ICtCpPQ, Display> = Color::new(1.0, 0.2, 0.2);
//!
//! let intensity = col.i; // acces I (Intensity) component through .i
//! let ct = col.ct; // access Ct (Chroma-Tritan) component through .ct
//! let cp = col.cp; // access Cp (Chroma-Protan) component through .cp
//! ```
//!
//! One more quite useful tool is the [`ConvertTo`] trait. [`ConvertTo`] is
//! a trait meant to be used as a replacement for [`Into`] in situations where you want
//! to bound a type as being able to be converted into a specific type of color. A you can
//! call [`.convert`][ConvertTo::convert] on a type that implements [`ConvertTo<T>`]
//! and you will get a `T`.
//!
//! This example snippet puts together much of what we've learned so far.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! fn tint_color(input_color: impl ConvertTo<Color<AcesCg, Display>>) -> Color<AcesCg, Display> {
//!     let color = input_color.convert();
//!     let tint: Color<AcesCg, Display> = Color::new(0.5, 0.8, 0.4);
//!     color * tint
//! }
//!
//! let color = color::srgb_u8(225, 200, 86);
//! let tinted: Color<EncodedSrgb, Display> = tint_color(color).convert();
//!
//! println!("Pre-tint: {}, Post-tint: {}", color, tinted);
//! ```
//!
//! Now, let's go back to our previous `decoded` color from the begining.
//!
//! Let's say that instead of blending perceptually between colors, we are creating a 3d rendering
//! engine. In this case, we probably want to do the actual shading math in a color space with a
//! wider (sharper) gamut (the reasons for this are outside the scope of this demo). The [ACEScg][AcesCg]
//! space is ideal for this.
//!
//! Since both color spaces are linear, the ideally optimized transformation is a simple
//! 3x3 matrix * 3 component vector multiplication. `colstodian` is architected such that we can still
//! just use the [`convert`][Color::convert] method to convert between these spaces and it will
//! indeed optimize fully down to just that multiplication.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let decoded = color::linear_srgb::<Display>(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
//! let col: Color<AcesCg, Display> = decoded.convert();
//! ```
//!
//! Now, we come to a bit of a subtle operation. Here we will convert the color from being in a display-reffered
//! state to being in a scene-referred state. This operation is not necessarily concrete, and is dependent on
//! the thing you are converting. Going from display-referred to scene-referred, we are converting from a
//! bounded dynamic range with physical reference units for the color component values being
//! (with a properly calibrated monitor) the **display standard specification**,
//! to an unbounded dynamic range, with color components in the range `[0..inf)` and the physical reference units
//! for these component values being the units used in the **scene,** which are defined by the renderer itself.
//! In most cases, these units will be in a measurement of photometric luminance like [Cd/m^2 aka nits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre).
//!
//! One possible use of this conversion is the case of an emissive texture, where we may want to modify the bounded
//! [illuminance (i.e. lux)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminance) of the color we stored in the texture by some
//! unbounded *power* value stored elsewhere. In this way, we can make emissive materials just as powerful as any other
//! light in the scene.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let col = color::acescg::<Display>(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
//! let power = 5.0; // Say you loaded this from an asset somewhere
//!
//! // Note the `Scene` state... previously, all colors have been in `Display` state.
//! let emissive_col: Color<AcesCg, Scene> = col.convert_state(|c| c * power);
//! ```
//!
//! Now we can do the actual rendering math, using this scene-referred color value.
//!
//! ```text
//! // ... rendering math here ...
//! ```
//!
//! Okay, so let's say we've ended up with a final color for a pixel, which is still scene-referred in the
//! ACEScg color space, representing the luminance reaching the camera from a specific direction (namely, the direction
//! corresponding to the pixel we are shading).
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! let rendered_col = color::acescg::<Scene>(5.0, 4.0, 4.5); // let's just say this is the computed final color.
//! ```
//!
//! Now we need to do the opposite of what we did before and map the infinite dynamic range of a
//! scene-referred color outputted by the renderer to the finite dynamic range which can be displayed
//! on a display. For an output display which is "SDR" (i.e. not an HDR-enabled TV or monitor), a fairly
//! aggressive S-curve style tonemap is a good option. We provide one in the form of the [`LottesTonemapper`],
//! which is a tonemapper inspired by [a talk given by AMD's Timothy Lottes](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023512/Advanced-Graphics-Techniques-Tutorial-Day).
//! See the documentation for more information on why it is a good choice.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let rendered_col = color::acescg::<Scene>(5.0, 4.0, 4.5);
//! use tonemapper::{LottesTonemapper, LottesTonemapperParams};
//!
//! // In reality you would change the parameters to fit the scene here.
//! let tonemapper = LottesTonemapper::new(LottesTonemapperParams::default());
//! let tonemapped: Color<AcesCg, Display> = rendered_col.tonemap(tonemapper);
//! ```
//!
//! Now, our color is display-referred within a finite (`[0..1]`) dynamic range. However, we haven't chosen
//! an actual specific display to encode it for. This is what the sRGB standard can help with, which
//! is most likely the standard upon which an LDR monitor will be based. We can convert our color to
//! [encoded sRGB][EncodedSrgb] just like we showed before.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let tonemapped = color::acescg::<Display>(5.0, 4.0, 4.5);
//! let encoded = tonemapped.convert::<EncodedSrgb>(); // Ready to display or write to an image.
//!
//! // Again, if your output format needs `u8`s (say, an 8-bit PNG image), you can use the `to_u8()` method.
//! let u8s: [u8; 3] = encoded.to_u8();
//! ```
//!
//! Alternatively, we could output to a different display, for example to a wide-gamut but still LDR
//! BT.2020 calibrated display:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use colstodian::*;
//! # let tonemapped = color::acescg::<Display>(5.0, 4.0, 4.5);
//! let encoded = tonemapped.convert::<EncodedBt2020>();
//! ```
//!
//! This doesn't cover displaying to an HDR display yet, nor the use of colors with an alpha channel, but it soon will!
